  # Final fix for RLS policies

  1. Changes
    - Drop all existing policies
    - Create new comprehensive policies with proper security checks
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Add proper security context checks
  
  2. Security
    - Ensure authenticated users can perform all operations
    - Maintain data integrity with proper constraints
